==========     VERSION 1.76    ==========

* No more outputting of the PREFIX.cad cluster information file
  The file generated is too large.

==========     VERSION 1.75    ==========

* The whole population is saved during the simulation
  The structure is an array of chromosomes: chrom_snapshot

* A new function was created called cluster. The function
  clusters the whole genetic algorithm individuals.

  the clustering step at the end of the GA
  The parameter is included in the docking input file

  CLRMSD <float_value>

==========     VERSION 1.74    ==========

* allocation of box now using malloc rather than calloc,
  due to errors on windows with calloc.

* Next to improve: box could be allocated only once 
  at the start of the program (dimension-issue)

  is selected (read access violation)

==========     VERSION 1.73    ==========

* floats have been changed to doubles in genetic algorithms genes
  parameters and in CF calculations.

  [0,1[ and this value is used to select the correct bin
  for a given parameter

==========     VERSION 1.69    ==========

* Modifies_pdb now lists ligands/modified a.a. as HETATM by default,
  if they are listed as ATOM
  However, they cannot be filtered out not including HET (INCHET)

* Optimization of vcfunction using double casts
  More precision when multiplying floats

* When an atom has type 0, we ensure complementarity is 0.000
  otherwise it would use block of memory[-1] (Type0 - 1 in matrix)

==========     VERSION 1.68    ==========

* Accounts for cases where residue names of RNA molecules are reversed
  e.g. '  C' --> 'C  '

* residue_conect is no longer executed when a RNA molecule is target

* Atom types are being assigned properly with RNA molecules

  A new function ensures the residue is a natural amino acids before
  reordering its atoms

==========     VERSION 1.66    ==========

* RNA molecules also go through modify_pdb.

* GLOBAL does not exist anymore.
  To do a GLOBAL simulation, you need to combine multiple clefts
  together. A grid will be built in all clefts.

==========     VERSION 1.65    ==========

* ori_atoms and rmsd_structures were removed.
  New member fields called coor_ori and coor_ref in atoms structure

  Only the matching atoms are used to calculate RMSD.
  (Matching residue number, name, chain and atom number)

* More than 3 GPA atoms are now possible.
  e.g.     0    0    0

        GPA2    0    0

  specify in which subgraph of the molecule the atom belongs to

==========     VERSION 1.61     ==========

* Bugfix: Fixed the bug when generating the grid from the ensemble
  of spheres

==========     VERSION 1.60     ==========

* LOCCLF now takes as input a sphere file (cleft spheres)
  instead of a pre-built grid. The grid is now built automatically
  at the start of each run using C++ code (maps) within the 
  function generate_grid

  generated within the boundaries of the sphere.

* Files partition_grid and slice_grid now uses C++ code.
  

==========     VERSION 1.58     ==========

  definition of types.
  e.g. when 12 types are read --> AMINO12.def will be used

  for dependencies files elsewhere

* radii.dat file is no longer necessary for 
  overriding FlexAID's default radii

  in constraints file, now automatically
  replaces '-' sign (no chain identifier) by ' '

  ligand file to force a reference protein center of geometry
  It allows to use the same one as the one used in the
  extraction process.

==========     VERSION 1.52     ==========

* Bugfix: nan happened when dividing by 0.0 when
  rebuilding atom coordinates. Perturbed atom
  coordinates.

* Contact areas between atoms now use the minimal area
  between in the 2 atoms in contact (min_areas function)
  	e.g. ( A --> B [30.0A^2] )
               B --> B [35.0A^2] )
	The area considered is 30.0

* Contact areas now use 'Radical Plane (R)' as opposed to
  'Extended Radical Plane (X)' in the Vcontacts function
  This allows better accuracy in contacting areas

* SAS calculations are now done within the vcfunction
  Previously, it was calculated within Vcontacts

* Bugfix: Intramolecular interactions of optimizable
  residues are now only calculated once

==========     VERSION 1.51     ==========

* Bugfix: order_pdb renamed to modify_pdb
  The function now controls filters applied
  such as removal of water/HETATM/H as well as 
  for the reordering of the PDB to match AMINO.def
  'A' conformations are saved by default  

==========     VERSION 1.50     ==========

  rather than using a fixed value against all atom types

* DEFTYP can be used to override the default
  atom definition files (AMINO.def/NUCLEOTIDES.def)

  but only for files writing in templates

==========     VERSION 1.30     ==========

* Fixed a bug when adding twice the same residue in flexible side-chains

* Constraints can now be as interaction between 2 atoms.
  A factor must be given, which multiplies the complementarity between those 2 atoms.
  Complementarity can be overriden (always be positive) by adding 'f' after the factor

     e.g.  INTERACT ...:10.0f 

* Added the SUPRNO in CONFIG.inp to explicitly assign SuperNodes Mode when using normal modes.

  The list still does not include extra-residue bonds (peptide bonds).

==========     VERSION 1.21     ==========

* Added a new field 'MAXRES' in order to cap the number of results generated at the end of the GA. The param
  has to be filled in CONFIG.inp. The number of results (%d) has to follow 'MAXRES'.
  By default, the number is always set to 10.

==========     VERSION 1.20     ==========

* Changed the bonded structure for optimizable residues. Instead of having a list of neighbours for each atom
  in the optimizable residue, the whole residue is shown as a matrix N x N, in which N is the number of atoms
  of the optimizable residue.

* Added the new constraints to the function 'vcfunction'.

* Added the details on CF for each optimizable residue(s) in result file(s).
